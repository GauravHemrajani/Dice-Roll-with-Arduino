# Dice Roll with Arduino
The "Dice Roll with Arduino" project is an interactive simulation of a dice roll using an Arduino, a pushbutton, and a 7-segment display. When the pushbutton is pressed, a loading animation is displayed on the 7-segment display, followed by a random number between 1 and 6 â€” simulating the roll of a dice. This project is perfect for beginners who want to improve their understanding of Arduino basics while creating fun, interactive electronic projects.

# How It Works
Pushbutton Activation: Pressing the pushbutton initiates the dice roll process.

Loading Animation: A "loading circle" effect is displayed on the 7-segment display by lighting up each segment in sequence, giving the illusion of rotation.

Random Dice Roll: After the loading animation, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated and displayed on the 7-segment display to simulate a dice roll.

# Materials Used
Arduino UNO: The main microcontroller board that powers the project.

7-Segment Common Cathode Display: Displays the loading animation and the dice roll result.

Pushbutton: Used to trigger the dice roll.

Breadboard: A prototyping board to connect the components.

Jumper Wires: Wires to connect the Arduino, display, and pushbutton.

# Software Used
Tinkercad: Used to create the circuit diagram and simulate the project before building it physically.

Arduino IDE: Used to write and upload the code to the Arduino UNO.

ChatGPT: Provided assistance throughout the project by offering code suggestions, troubleshooting tips, and explanations for complex parts of the project, helping streamline development and resolve any issues quickly.

# Code Breakdown
The code is designed to handle the following functions:

Setup and Initialization: Configures the pins connected to the 7-segment display and the pushbutton. It also initializes the random number generator.

Loading Circle Animation: Uses a sequence of digital writes to create a circular animation on the 7-segment display.

Random Dice Roll: When the button is pressed, the loading circle animation is displayed, followed by a random number between 1 and 6, which is generated and shown on the 7-segment display.

Display Functions: Individual functions for each number (1 to 6) display the corresponding segments on the 7-segment display.
