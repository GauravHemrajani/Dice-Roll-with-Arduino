# Dice-Roll-with-Arduino
Dice Roll with Arduino – Designed a digital dice roller using Arduino, a pushbutton, and a 7-segment display. Pressing the button triggers a "loading circle," followed by a random number display (1–6) to mimic a dice roll. This project highlights skills in microcontroller programming and electronics, creating an interactive, functional display.
